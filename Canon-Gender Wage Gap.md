#### *_Introduction_* 
As the 21st century uploads, deep economic and global challenges affect the external factors of the Labor Market. It is well-known that factors outside the organization such as, economy, government and unions regulate these forces that shape the employment framework and determine the level of wages and benefits of employees. An adequate compensation system that deals with every type of fair reward of employees, considers being a significant tool for the Human Resource Management function.  

Nowadays, there are numerous causes that bring about the gender wage gap (GWG) , which is one case of unfair compensation between men and women. Neoclassical Economics can expose these causes at a significant point through concepts as utility maximization, self-interest and fixed preferences. However, recent studies have started to concentrate their analysis on behavioral and psychological aspects that affect considerably the GWG. Nonetheless, it has to be mentioned that Behavioral Economics contribute complementarily to Neoclassical Economics and they do not try to define a new dimension for the GWG and for the whole field of Labor Economics. These wage inequalities across gender have as a result to affect the choices of employees and employers, which constitute the human pool of labor participation.  

#### *_Causes of gender wage gap and its relation with labor participants’ choices_*  
Even though the gender wage gap (GWG) has diminished over the last ten years (see figure 1), it is still prevalent and the predictions for its attenuation are not optimistic for the near future. The GWG varies across countries (see figure 2) but also by age, by educational level, by working profile (part-time/full-time jobs), by occupation and by sector (public or private).

First of all, one of the main reasons for the existence of GWG is that women are more likely to reduce the working hours or temporarily interrupt their careers in order to meet family responsibilities; as taking care of children or other family members.  This has negative results in both their job experience and their potential career earnings. The most obvious evidence that women’s career interruption contributes negatively to their earnings, is when they become mothers and bear a “mommy penalty”. Namely, mothers receive less money, on average, when they return to work after giving birth compared to non-mothers.  

Secondly, in general part-time jobs are mostly dominated by women. More specifically, females have the tendency to find part-time jobs for the purpose of balancing their work with their private life. Even though this decision is sometimes a personal choice, in most of the cases it is driven by noneconomic reasons, such as childcare, or other family related obligations. This proportional difference between part-time and full-time jobs among the two sexes results to an earnings penalty and consequently to a wider gender wage gap. Also, it has to be mentioned that women with less working hours, they are more likely to qualify for less social benefits.  

From the behavioral aspect, the aforementioned causes are based not only on the choices of women but also on the behavior of employers towards them. Indeed, there are occupations, in which females’ work value is underestimated, even though they require the same skills, qualifications and experience. Employers are inclined to perceive women as potential mothers, which is not only a sign of lower commitment and professional competence level, but also a reason for denying promotion opportunities.  Moreover, concerning the female employees in part-time jobs, there is less interaction between them and employers (this is mentioned as “face time” in some economic papers). This means that the latter start to build the perception that the former are less dedicated to their work and more likely to resign in order to concentrate on their family obligations than their male colleagues. Therefore, there is a significant possibility that employers undervalue women’s work preserving a gender wage gap. At last, employers’ behavior sometimes seems to be irrational because they pay less money to women than men or they do not prefer to hire women, even though the latter can be as productive as their male counterparts.  

Thirdly, segregation in the labor market is another important factor that boosts the GWG. It is widely accepted that women and men tend to work in different jobs and fields. In particular, women are inclined to dominate in sectors, such as education, health or public administration, which traditionally pay lower wages than sectors where men outweigh. Additionally, women constitute the majority of lower paid occupations within the same field, as finance or medicine. For example, concerning the sector of medicine, women are mainly occupied as nurses and only a small part of them are surgeons, doctors and diagnosticians. Also, a significant part of female workforce is occupied with professions, like caregiving, which are not compensated with the real value of work that employers offer because of the fact that their work is difficult to be quantified. Females are also underrepresented in leadership in both private and public sector, while it is more possible to have managerial or senior positions at large companies than at small or medium-size firms.  

Whilst occupational segregation is inextricably linked with employers’ personal choices and fixed preferences, it is truth that traditions and stereotypes (social norms) represent another considerable factor. Indeed, traditions and stereotypes usually steer women into certain educational paths and subsequently into specific professional careers. According to research, females are more likely to study in fields as education, social sciences and humanities, while they do not show preference for studying subjects as computing, mathematics and engineering, which traditionally lead to higher paying jobs.  

The main reason for the above situation is that in society there have been developed norms, which lead women to perceive themselves to be unable to succeed in mathematics and science studies, and as a result they end up to lower-paying jobs. Furthermore, fewer females hold a position at higher-paying jobs, which are in general linked with male-dominated professions. Therefore, there are fewer teachers and mentors, who advise young girls to take courses as math, physics and chemistry, decreasing the possibility for the latter to find a job with high wages.  

Behavioral economists support that GWG is due not only to discrimination and differences in preferences that are created by stereotypes, but also to psychological, non-cognitive factors like differences in competitiveness and confidence. Namely, gender differences in competitiveness and confidence are considered potential causes for differences in educational choices and consequently career path. More specifically, competitiveness is a fundamental attribute for specific study fields, as math and sciences which by nature are viewed more competitive and more prestigious than other fields, like health and social sciences. A research, which is conducted by Niederle and Vesterlund, shows that girls with the same academic skills and abilities as boys behave less competitively and have less confidence in themselves. Therefore, the former are more likely to choose no-prestigious educational profiles which are viewed as more likely to be completed. As a consequence, females’ tendency to less competitive educational profiles illuminates the fact that fewer females are presented in high-paying jobs preserving the GWG.
