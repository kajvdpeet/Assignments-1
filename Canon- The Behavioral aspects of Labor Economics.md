## The Behavioral aspects of Labor Economics





#### *_Introduction_* 
This paper reviews several topics in which behavioral aspects influence labor market outcomes that cannot be explained exclusively by neoclassical economics. Behavioral economics is a step in the right direction in explaining the outcomes observed in the real world.

Behavioral economics is the study of the economic decision making processes of individuals and institutions affected by cognitive and emotional factors. This field provides insights on non-rational behavior and human interaction. Behavioral economics can provide vital understanding of labor market outcomes and especially add upon the insights provided by neoclassical economics, as human behavior can greatly affect labor market decisions. 

In the following parts we discuss topics of labor economics that have remarkable real world results. We will start by looking at the main causes of the gender wage gap especially where these causes stem from behavior of all those involved in the firm and also its customers. Secondly we will look at how employee motivation is determined and affected by the behavior and trust exhibited by employers and by how they are rewarded for their efforts. Thirdly we will look at how labor unions bargain for among other things the wages of employees in certain sectors and how specifically they do not act solely out of self-interest such as classical economics suggests. Finally we will see how job search decisions for both the employed as well as the unemployed, who are willing to work, are affected by time preferences, such as impatience, and other behavioral variables that affect the job search decision.


#### *_Gender wage gap & Labor participation choices_*  
The first topic that we address is the root of existence of wage gaps. Gender wage gap is the difference between the average gross hourly earnings of men and women expressed as a percentage of the average gross hourly earnings of men. Nowadays, there are numerous causes that bring about the gender wage gap (GWG), which is one case of unfair compensation between men and women. Neoclassical Economics can expose these causes at a significant point through concepts as utility maximization, self-interest and fixed preferences. However, recent studies have started to concentrate their analysis on behavioral and psychological aspects that affect considerably the GWG.

Nonetheless, it has to be mentioned that Behavioral Economics contributes complementarily to Neoclassical Economics. It is important to note that they do not try to define a new dimension for the GWG, but are merely trying to look at it from a different perspective. These wage inequalities across gender affect the choices of employees and employers, which constitute the human pool of labor participation.

Even though the gender wage gap (GWG) has diminished over the last ten years (see figure 1), it is still prevalent and the predictions for its attenuation are not optimistic for the near future. The GWG not only varies across countries (see figure 2) but also by age, by educational level, by working profile (part-time/full-time jobs), by occupation and by sector (public or private).

One of the main reasons for the existence of GWG is that women are more likely to reduce the working hours or temporarily interrupt their careers in order to meet family responsibilities; such as taking care of children or other family members. This has negative results in both their job experience and their potential career earnings. The most obvious evidence that women's career interruption contributes negatively to their earnings, is when they become mothers and bear a "mommy penalty". Namely, mothers receive less money, on average, when they return to work after giving birth compared to non-mothers.

Moreover, in general part-time jobs are mostly dominated by women. More specifically, females have the tendency to find part-time jobs for the purpose of balancing their work with their private life. Even though this decision is sometimes a personal choice, in most of the cases it is driven by non-economic reasons, such as childcare. This proportional difference between part-time and full-time jobs among the two sexes results to an earnings penalty and consequently to a wider gender wage gap.

From the behavioral aspect, the aforementioned causes are based not only on the choices of women but also on the behavior of employers towards them. Indeed, there are occupations in which females’ work value is underestimated, even though they require the same skills, qualifications and experience. Employers are inclined to perceive women as potential mothers, which is not only a sign of lower commitment and professional competence level, but also a reason for denying promotion opportunities. Moreover, concerning the female employees in part-time jobs, there is less interaction between them and employers (often referred to as “face time” by economists). This means that the latter start to build the perception that the former are less dedicated to their work and more likely to resign in order to concentrate on their family obligations than their male counterparts. Therefore, there is a significant possibility that employers undervalue women's work preserving a gender wage gap. It is often the case that employers' behavior sometimes seems to be irrational because they pay less money to women than to men or they do not prefer to hire women, even though the latter can be as productive as their male counterparts. This could make these firms less competitive and non-sustainable in a perfectly competitive market but in an imperfect market these differences may persist.

Behavioral economists claim that GWG exists not only because of discrimination and differences in preferences that are created by stereotypes, but also to psychological, non-cognitive factors like differences in competitiveness and confidence. Namely, gender differences in competitiveness and confidence are considered potential causes for differences in educational choices and consequently career path. More specifically, competitiveness is a fundamental attribute for specific study fields, as math and sciences which by nature are viewed more competitive and more prestigious than other fields, like health and social sciences. A research which is conducted by Niederle and Vesterlund shows that girls with the same academic skills and abilities as boys behave less competitively and have less confidence in themselves. Therefore, the former are more likely to choose non-prestigious educational profiles which are viewed as more likely to be completed. As a consequence, females' tendency to less competitive educational profiles illuminates the fact that fewer females are presented in high-paying jobs preserving the GWG.

Another cause for a gap between earnings for male and female employees in some sectors is the preference of firm customers for either of the gender. If for instance customers prefer the firm to have male employees they will pay a lower price for products of that firm if the latter employs females too. This causes firms to segregate by gender of employees such that firms with only male employees ask high prices and thus pay high wages, whereas firms with only female employees charge low prices, paying also low wages to their female employees. This cause for the wage gap persists even in perfect labor markets (Van Ours, Boeri).
  

#### *_Employee motivation_*  

In this section, we will use insights from various economists to question how employee motivation is affected by trust exhibited by employers. The way firms motivate and retain their employees is a potentially interesting question to look at, since it can have effects on how the labor markets operate. By use of experimental methods for evaluating labor economics, the field is now open to new insights. This makes it possible to uncover drivers and nature of human motivation.

There are largely two types of motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is driven by external rewards, such as higher wages and bonuses. Intrinsic motivation on the other hand, entails doing an activity simply for inherent satisfaction or pleasure. The effects of motivation can be seen by worker effort. However, if there was a standard measure for effort, firms would pay wages based on that. For instance, the field experiment conducted by Gneezy and List at an undergraduate university measures worker effort by average number of books logged into the computer. This study suggests that worker effort in first few hours on the job is higher when the worker is being paid more than his initial expectations. However, it is interesting to see that the overall effort of higher wages is not that noticeable after the first few hours.

Furthermore, worker's efforts can also be viewed by various signals to the employer. The X-efficiency theory relates to this idea that workers being monitored by managers tend to feel distrusted and they respond by shirking from work (supplying lower level of effort). Hence, one can clearly see there is a mutually beneficial exchange from reducing monitoring and higher voluntary levels of effort. Moreover, this also emphasizes on the importance of interaction between productivity and worker morale, which is a conventional measure of economic efficiency fail to identify.

Behavioral economists have devoted a lot of attention to asking how increasing worker participation in production decisions and relatively more control benefit the firms. Ideally, there exists an efficient level of participation for distributing control over workers, managers and owners. Several behavioral analysts suggest that firms should promote workplace decentralization. Not all economists share this idealistic view, cynics like Putterman, have pointed out that worker controlled firms may not be able to compete in the business world on a large scale. This may be that workers generally lack the experience that managers have which may have adverse effects on the firms’ investment financing.

Another way to affect worker effort is reciprocity. Positive reciprocity is a favorable response to friendly actions while negative reciprocity entails punishment of hostile acts as shown by Fehr and Gächter in their paper titled "Fairness in the labor market". Psychologists and economists have shown that reciprocity is a driver of human motivation. However, Kube, Puppe and Marechal show that non-monetary gifts have a much stronger impact on worker effort than monetary ones. Generally, the effect of higher wages is somewhat debated and varies on context. On the other hand, negative reciprocity potentially has greater effect on labor market outcomes than positive reciprocity. Krueger and Mas (2004) discuss labor strife at a U.S. tire production site which coincided with the production of substantially lower-quality tires. They argue that it was the result of less effort from workers during the strife. The reciprocity also comes into play when talking about labor unions. This will be discussed more in the next section.
 

#### *_Labor unions & functions of bargaining in labor negotiations_*  

Labor unions are organizations that negotiate with corporations, businesses and other organizations on behalf of union members. There are trade unions, which represent workers who do a particular type of job, and industrial unions, which represent workers in a particular industry. Labor unions have two main tools of influence: restricting labor supply and increasing labor demand. Collective bargaining, i.e. the negotiations between the group of employees and the employer, is a process in which workers (represented by the union) and the employers meet to discuss the employment environment. Generally unions will present their issues with the current state of affairs and employers either have to conceit to their demands or give counterarguments. This collective bargaining is a continuous relationship between the unions and the employers. Walton and Mckersie (1991) give four distinct functions of bargaining in labor negotiations.  

Firstly they say that the most obvious function is the bargaining over wages. They compare the bargaining over wages to a zero-sum game. A zero-sum game is a situation in which each participants gain or loss is balanced by the gains/losses by the other participants. This can simply be explained by the idea of a fixed pie, which has to be divided over a number of participants. If one participant gets a bigger part of the pie, then another participant will get a smaller part.  

The second function they address is the so-called integrative function, which aims at increasing the benefits for both parties. So apart from trying to get a bigger part of the pie for employees, unions will also try to make the entire pie bigger. This will benefit both the employees and the employers.  

The third function they mention is the so-called attitudinal bargaining. In general workers and managers care about the relationship between the workers and managers. So this form of bargaining is aimed at expanding nonfinancial benefits stemming from on-the-job social interactions.  

The fourth and final function they talk about is the intra-organizational part of the bargaining. Sometimes the bargaining focuses on the interests of third parties, since there are more parties influenced by the outcomes of the negotiations than just the employees and managers. For example, unemployed people are heavily influenced if the labor unions are aiming to increase minimal wages. If minimum wages get increased the demand for labor will go down and it will be harder for unemployed people to get a job. So these external effects for other parties are also taken into account by the labor unions when they are bargaining with the managers.  

The first key aspect of behavioral economics that is relevant is the theory of rational choice. This implies that during the bargaining both parties will selfishly try to maximize their benefits, possibly at the expense of the other party. So looking at the first function of unions, the labor union will try to maximize the part of the pie that they get, at the expense of the part of the pie the employers will get. However, if they can get a bigger part of the pie by cooperating then both parties will have interest in doing so.  

It’s not always the case that participants will try to maximize their own share of the pie without taking into account the share of the pie that the other party will get.  Another important behavioral aspect in play is that of reciprocity. This can both be negative and positive. In the case of positive reciprocity people will choose to give a bigger part of the pie to other participants, decreasing their own, because they believe it’s fair. So in the case of labor unions both parties might take into account what is fair in their opinion. Managers might feel that employees have the right for a higher wage than is optimal for maximizing profits, because they believe it is fair.  

Reciprocity can also be negative. If someone wants to give payback to someone else because they feel they have been mistreated, they might give up a piece of the pie in order to decrease the piece of the pie for the other party as well. Labor unions have a strong position since they can threaten with a strike if employers fail to meet their demands. In most cases there mere availability of a strike option is enough for employers to alter their behavior. “The mere availability of the strike option appears to raise the teacher salaries by as much as 10 percent.”  (Delaney 1983).  

Lastly, another important factor in labor union bargaining is altruism. During the bargaining not only the interests of the employees and employers are taken into account, but also those of third parties. Labor unions also care about the people that are currently unemployment and are willing to decrease their share of the pie in order to make sure that the unemployed people are not too negatively influenced by the outcome of their negotiations.  

#### *_Job-search Decisions_*  

In this section, we will discuss behavioral concepts around job search decisions: people are not always fully rational and are interested in other factors than only ‘the simple cost-benefit trade-off decision’. There are two types of job search decisions: Workers who currently have a job are searching for a job and people who are not currently working are searching for a job.   

In economics it is often discussed how individuals value money in the future less than they do right now because of impatience and sometimes inflation. This effect is called the discounting of future value of money. In classical economics this discounting is often assumed to happen at an exponential rate, known as exponential discounting. This form of discounting is often used in the analysis of individual choice over time. This concept was widely used in analyzing decision making in labor markets, however, research in behavioral economics provided evidence that criticizes it. In particular, Thaler and Benartzi evaluate time-inconsistent choice behavior by analyzing employee saving behavior in the long term. This has led to developing various non-exponential discounting models, such as hyperbolic discounting models.  

Hyperbolic discounting refers to the tendency for people to increasingly choose a smaller-sooner reward over a larger-later reward as the delay occurs sooner rather than later in time. DellaVigna and Paserman in their paper “Job search and impatience” make use of hyperbolic discounting to study decision-making in labor markets. For example, people who can choose between €1000 now and €2000 in a year would most likely go for the first option. When they can choose between €1000 in four years and €2000 in five years most people would go for the last option. This is striking because in both options the interval is one year, which means that people are discounting the short-term more heavily than the long-term. They look into how impatience comes into play while people search for jobs. Furthermore, they have also provided evidences for the existence of time-inconsistent agents who end up investing less effort in job search than they retrospectively wish to have done. This mean that these people are more likely to accept a job offer sooner and therefore they will work for a lower wage compared to a job offer they could get later.  

Moreover, Paserman (2008) also investigated the possibility of hyperbolic discounting. His results could mean that there is hyperbolic discounting for low and medium wage workers and discussed possible policies to successfully decrease the short-term discounting of the hyperbolic workers.  He advises to implement a policy to make people exert more effort in the short-term and make a better choice of a job they accept and increases their starting wage.  

On the other hand, when employees have incentives to leave a job and switch to another job is called the ‘turnover’ of workers. This turnover decision is affected by more than just monetary cost benefit analysis. Behavioral factors such as commitment, work values or social network, influence these decisions in a way that a job could be beneficial in monetary terms but the worker may not want to turnover because he values these factors higher than just earning a higher wage. Iverson and Roy (1994) studied the effect of behavioral commitment on the turnover of workers, by combining economic, psychological and sociological variables into a model. This hypothesis model can be seen in Figure 3.  The + stands for a positive effect on the next box, the – stands for a negative effect on the next box. For example when an employee obtains a good wage this has a positive effect on job satisfaction. Job satisfaction has a positive effect on attitudinal commitment and this process has a negative effect on job search. Consequently a negative effect on job search will lead to a positive effect on behavioral commitment.  So in the end all of these variables have an effect on job search, positive or negative.  

Following this approach Iverson and Roy found that the variable equity directly influenced the job search in a negative way, with a coefficient higher than 0.2, which points out the importance of this variable. This means that if an employee will be fairly treated with distributing rewards of the firm, like a bonus when the company is performing well, he or she will have a higher level of loyalty to the organization. Consequently this will lead to a negative effect on the job search. Beside this equity variable, the variables instrumental communication, work unit size, pay, routinization and kinship responsibility were found statistically insignificant. This means that there is no valid evidence that these variables influence the boxes.  

Equity, Promotional Opportunity, Job security and Met Expectations are the strongest variables. We can conclude that the higher the job satisfaction the lower the job search of these employees. The advantage of this is that still a significant fraction of the variables directly influences job satisfaction.  

All in all, it is important to look at behavioral perspectives in designing and implementing policies to efficiently influence labor market outcomes. However, it is difficult to reach all the people where the policy is aimed at because they have different values or different personalities. It could be that there are other reasons or processes that influence the decisions of labors (employed or unemployed). Nonetheless, considering insights from behavioral economics and including such factors one can certainly help to improve policies aimed at labors’ decisions and in turn the outcome of these policies.
